### d3examples

Karl W Broman,
[http://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~kbroman](http://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~kbroman)

Examples of interactive graphics using [d3](http://d3js.org).

See these in action [here](http://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~kbroman/D3).

I have some additional simple examples in my [JSbroman](http://github.com/kbroman/JSbroman) repository.


There is some really awful code in here.
I just barely know what I'm doing.
